SimpleTimer v1.2

Description:
With SimpleTimer you can create timers and reminders for your daily chores or other duties you have to accomplish during the day or week. The user interface allows you to quickly set up a reminder (e.g. to remember to do laundry 45 minutes from now), but it's easy to enable more advanced scheduling operations. However, SimpleTimer does not aim to replace utilities like cron. When the timer expires, you can:
- print a alert message on the screen,
- open a web page with the preferred browser or mail application,
- play a sound (MP3, AIFF, etc.)

Requirements:
SimpleTimer v1.2 runs on Max OS X 10.2 and higher. This is a Universal Binary, so it also should run on Intel hardware, although this has not been tested.

Installation:
Just drag the SimpleTimer application icon wherever you want.

Note about use:
Use 24-hour format for "At Date" field.

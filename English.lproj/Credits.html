SimpleTimer 1.2 was developed using the Cocoa/OpenStep framework. It was tested on Mac OS X 10.4 only, using a PPC processor: however, it should work fine on Mac OS X 10.3 and 10.2, as well as Intel machines. (SimpleTimer 1.2 is a universal binary.) You are welcome to <a href="http://cubelogic.org/">report bugs</a>.

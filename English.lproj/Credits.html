<strong>SimpleTimer</strong> allows you to create timers and reminders for your daily chores. When the timer expires, you can: print a alert message on the screen, open a web page with the preferred browser or mail application, or play a sound (MP3, AIFF, etc.)</p>

<h3>Support</h3>
<p>
SimpleTimer was developed using the Cocoa/OpenStep framework. It was tested on Mac OS X 10.6 (intel) and 10.3 (ppc): however, it should work fine on Mac OS X 10.1 and up. (SimpleTimer since version 1.2 is a Universal Binary.)</p>

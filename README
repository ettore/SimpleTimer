SimpleTimer v1.3

Description:
With SimpleTimer you can create timers and reminders for your daily chores or duties. The user interface allows you to quickly set up a reminder (e.g. to remember to do laundry 45 minutes from now), but it's easy to enable more advanced scheduling operations. (However, SimpleTimer does not aim to replace advanced scheduling utilities like cron.) When the timer expires, you can:
- print a alert message on the screen,
- open a web page with the preferred browser or mail application,
- play a sound (MP3, AIFF, etc.)

Requirements:
SimpleTimer v1.3 runs on Max OS X 10.1 and higher. 
This is a Universal Binary, so it runs on PPC and Intel machines.

Installation:
Just drag the SimpleTimer application icon wherever you want.

Note about the "At Date" field format:
The "At Date" field accepts date/time in the following format only: 
YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss (year-month-day hour:minutes:seconds) with 24-hour format.

Source-code:
Freely available at http://cubelogic.org/simpletimer. Current code is available at the following SVN repository: http://cubelogic.org/stimer/
There's an older CVS repository at SourceForge.net but it is (and inevitably will be) rather outdated: http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/clsimpletimer/src/

Help needed:
I am looking for testers for the following systems: Mac OS X 10.1, 10.2, 10.4, 10.5.  The current SimpleTimer version (1.3) has been tested only on Mac OS X 10.6 (intel) and 10.3 (ppc). If you are interested in contributing to SimpleTimer, please email me and we'll work something out. Your name will be included in the credits.
